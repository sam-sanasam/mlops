What is the regular DS lifecycle

How the MLFlow makes simple the entire lifecycle


- how to track the model build parameter
- How to tract the multiple model build
- How to validate the model
  - by inferencing
  - by loading the .pickel file using mlflow.pyfunc
- How to save the model

## End to end MLFLow implementation on ML project
Let us take Iris dataset to create the model. Once the model is created we will implement MLFLow to tract the model, its build parameters, and scores etc.
Steps:
- Build the model using Iris dataset
- Implement MLFlow
